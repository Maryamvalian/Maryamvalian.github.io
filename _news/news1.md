Today marks not the beginning of my teaching career but a new milestone in continuing my passion for education in Canada. I'm thrilled to announce that I have joined McMaster University's Computing and Software (CAS) department as a sessional instructor! This semester, I will be teaching COMPSCI 2GA3: Computer Architecture, a subject close to my heart.

I look forward to inspiring and being inspired by the incredible students at McMaster. Here's to an exciting semester ahead!
