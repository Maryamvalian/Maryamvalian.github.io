ðŸŒŸ Exciting News! ðŸŒŸ
I'm thrilled to share that I have been awarded third for my poster presentation at the Sixth Computing and Software Demo and Poster Competition held at McMaster University! ðŸŽ‰
This recognition is a testament to the hard work and dedication I have put into my research, and I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to present alongside such talented individuals.
A huge thank you to my mentors, peers, and the organizing committee for their support and encouragement throughout this journey.
Looking forward to continuing my research and contributing to the field of computing and software!
