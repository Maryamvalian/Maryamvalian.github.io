Greetings! I'm Maryam, a passionate researcher and educator in the field of computer science. Currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at McMaster University since September 2022.

My academic journey commenced at Zanjan University in Iran, where I pursued my bachelor's degree in Software engineering. After this I got my master's degree, specializing in diverse areas such as Bayesian networks, evolutionary algorithms, and human-computer interaction. Graduating with distinction, I laid a strong foundation for my future research endeavours.

 My thirst for knowledge and academic prowess was nurtured during my formative years at the National Organization of Exceptionally Talented Students of Iran (NODET) during high school.

In addition to my research pursuits, I bring over a decade of enriching experience in teaching various computer science courses at the prestigious Azad University of Iran. From Database Management to Network Switching and Routing, from Formal Languages and Automata to Java Programming, I have had the privilege of shaping the minds of budding technologists. Mentoring students and witnessing their growth fuels my passion for education, and I aspire to continue this journey of imparting knowledge in the future.
