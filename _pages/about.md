Hi, I’m Maryam Valian, a passionate educator and a PhD candidate at McMaster University, working in <a href='http://christianbrodbeck.net'>Dr. Christian Brodbeck’s lab</a>. Our research is dedicated to uncovering the mysteries of the brain using cutting-edge computational techniques—a thrilling intersection of neuroscience and computer science. With over 10 years of teaching experience, I love sharing my knowledge and inspiring students in computer science courses. Teaching is more than a profession for me; it’s my passion, and I’m excited to keep making an impact both in the classroom and in research.
